Title: Data Retention Policy

Purpose
This long-form policy explains how long different categories of data are retained, the legal basis, and deletion workflows. This document is intentionally long to test smart chunking for embeddings.

1. Introduction
Our company retains data only for as long as necessary to fulfill business and legal requirements. This policy sets the retention periods and responsibilities.

2. Scope
This applies to: employee records, customer data, logs, backups, analytics, marketing leads, and financial records.

3. Employee Records
- Recruitment: applications and resumes are kept for 2 years by default.
- HR records: employment contracts and payroll retained for 7 years.

4. Customer Data
- Transactional data: 7 years for financial audit.
- Support tickets: 3 years; aggregated analytics may be stored longer in anonymized form.
- Account recovery artifacts (e.g., password reset tokens) are stored only briefly and are deleted after use or timeout.

5. Logs and Telemetry
- System logs retained for 90 days in hot storage and archived for 1 year in cold storage.
- Access logs used for security investigations may be retained up to 3 years.

6. Backups
- Daily backups retained for 30 days, weekly backups for 12 weeks, monthly backups for 12 months, annual snapshots for 7 years.

7. Deletion and Disposal
- Data deletion is done through automated jobs; manual requests go through Data Governance.
- Secure disposal for physical media per company security protocols.

8. Legal Holds
- If litigation or investigation occurs, relevant data may be placed on legal hold and preserved beyond normal retention.

9. International Considerations
- Data locality and retention rules may vary by country; local laws may override standard retention.

10. Roles & Responsibilities
- Data owners determine retention (within constraints).
- IT and Security implement deletion and retention controls.
- Compliance monitors adherence and audits.
