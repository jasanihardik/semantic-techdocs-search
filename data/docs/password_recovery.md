Title: Password Recovery Process

Overview
Our password recovery process helps employees regain access when they've forgotten a password or cannot log in.

Steps:
1. Visit the company login page and click "Forgot password".
2. Enter your employee email; an email with a password reset link will be sent.
3. Click the link (expires in 60 minutes) and set a new password that meets complexity rules.
4. If you can't access your email, contact IT Support and request a manual password reset.
5. For multi-factor enrolled accounts, you may be asked to verify using your authenticator app.

Notes:
- Password complexity: minimum 12 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and symbol.
- Password history: last 5 passwords cannot be reused.
- For service accounts, contact IT to coordinate a controlled reset during a maintenance window.
