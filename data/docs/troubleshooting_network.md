Title: Troubleshooting Network Issues (Home Office)

Common network problems and fixes when working remotely.

Symptoms:
- Cannot connect to internal apps.
- Very slow or intermittent connections.
- VPN connects but services are unreachable.

Checklist:
1. Verify home router is online; reboot router if necessary.
2. Test speed; if internet is unstable, use wired connection.
3. Confirm VPN connection and authentication.
4. Check local firewall rules and antivirus.

If unable to restore connectivity, escalate to IT via the ticketing system and reference the VPN Access and Password Recovery Process if authentication fails.
