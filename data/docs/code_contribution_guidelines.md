Title: Code Contribution Guidelines

How to contribute to internal repositories.

Process:
- Fork the repository and open a pull request.
- Ensure tests pass and follow the coding style guide.
- Link Jira ticket to your PR.
- For permission issues (e.g., cannot push), contact platform admins or use the Password Recovery Process if access credentials fail.

Review guidelines:
- Use small focused commits.
- Include test coverage for new features.
