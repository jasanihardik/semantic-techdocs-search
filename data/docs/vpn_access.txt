VPN Access and Setup

To connect remotely to internal systems, use the company VPN.

Steps:
1. Install the VPN client (Windows/Mac/Linux).
2. Use your corporate credentials and MFA to authenticate.
3. If you are blocked, try resetting via the password recovery process or contact IT Support.

Troubleshooting:
- If remote work resources are inaccessible, confirm VPN is connected and your firewall allows the VPN client.
- If you are trying to "access internal tools from home", this document describes the VPN setup and remote access steps.

Security reminder:
- Do not share VPN credentials. Use company-managed devices where possible.
