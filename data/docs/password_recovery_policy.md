Corporate Password Recovery & Account Security Policy
1. Purpose

This policy outlines the procedures employees must follow to securely recover access to their corporate accounts when passwords are forgotten, compromised, or require mandatory updates. The goal is to maintain strong security standards while ensuring quick recovery with minimal downtime.

2. When Password Recovery Is Required

You must initiate the password recovery process if:

You forgot your corporate account password

You are locked out after too many failed login attempts

You suspect your password has been compromised

You receive an alert from IT Security about suspicious activity

You are returning from extended leave and your password expired

You switched devices and need to authenticate again

3. Password Recovery Methods
3.1 Self-Service Password Reset (Primary Method)

Most password issues can be resolved through the Self-Service Password Portal.

Follow these steps:

Go to the internal recovery portal:
https://password-reset.corp.internal

Enter your corporate email address

Choose a verification method:

Secondary email

SMS code

Authenticator app challenge

Set a new password following policy rules

Log in again using your updated credentials

This method is available 24/7 and requires no IT support.

4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Requirements

For enhanced security, the recovery process may require MFA validation:

6-digit authenticator app code

Push notification approval

SMS or secondary email code

Security backup codes (if enabled earlier)

If you lose access to your MFA device, see Section 5.

5. Lost MFA Device Procedure

If you lose access to your phone, hardware token, or authenticator app:

Contact IT Security via service desk

Provide identity verification:

Employee ID

HR validation

Security questions

Request an MFA reset

Re-enroll MFA on your new device

IT Security is prohibited from revealing any previous codes or device details.

6. Password Requirements

New passwords must meet the following criteria:

Minimum 12 characters

At least one uppercase letter

At least one lowercase letter

At least one number

At least one symbol

Cannot repeat any of the last 5 passwords

Cannot contain your name, username, or email

Passwords expire every 180 days unless otherwise mandated.

7. If Your Account Is Compromised

If you suspect unauthorized activity:

Immediately reset your password

Enable MFA (if not already)

Contact IT with any suspicious emails, login attempts, or device logs

Security investigations typically take 24–48 hours.

8. IT Support Availability

For escalations beyond self-service:

Weekdays: 8 AM – 6 PM local time

After-hours: Emergency security hotline
